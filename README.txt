Description:

Frontpage for a Campaign with flip-pics and save sharing with facebook, google and twitter. 
Make sure that the plugin is at the bottom of all plugins!
Required plugin: File 

Many thanks to 13 and sem. (i use the code from "phloor_flipwall", "phloor_socialshareprivacy" and "videolist")

How to make the frontpage campaign:

Load with the file plugin 4 Pictures with 'title' #1#, #2#, #3#, #4# and give every file a description.
This pitures are the front-sides of the flip-pictures (the title is not shown)
The description ist the backside of the flip-pictures

Load videos from youtube, blib, giss, metacafe or vimeo (be sure not to use NOT the 'embeded url')
After loading, edit the video-file and change the title with a leading # (example: #1 My Video)

Go to the frontpage campaign plugin settings and edit (like in the setting described) and save.

That's all.
